          Undoubtedly, one of my absolute favorite things to do in Seattle is to hop in a kayak and paddle around Lake Union and beyond. With local facilities that make renting a kayak easy and relatively inexpensive, you'll be off in no time. If you've got a hankering to try it out, or if you're looking for tips to make your paddling experiencea bout as great as it can be, take a look at this page and kayak your way to northwest bliss.

        <h2>What to wear when kayaking?</h2>
        <p>Great question and I'm glad you asked. <b>Mostly, you'll be dry</b>, so there's no need for a swimsuit or goggles. My suggestion: think comfort and think flexibility. I like to go out in a pair of old <b>sneakers</b> (you probably won't want to barefoot it, as there are pedals on both the right and left hand sides of the kayak to operate the rudder in back), <b>t-shirt and/or sweatshirt</b> (depending on the temperature) and <b>shorts or sweatpants</b> (also depending on the weather). Also, you'll want to <b>bring a hat </b>to keep the sun off your head and sunscreen for the rest of you. All that water reflects a LOT of sun and you don't want to get lobsterized.</p>
